## Credits

This game uses several assets that were created by various artists. I would like to give full credit to the creators of these resources:

The character sprites were generated using the [Universal LPC Spritesheet Generator](https://sanderfrenken.github.io/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator) created by Sander Frenken. The generator is based on the assets from the [Liberated Pixel Cup](https://lpc.opengameart.org), which are available on [OpenGameArt.org](OpenGameArt.org).

The Liberated Pixel Cup assets are also used for the maps, objects and items.

Please check out these resources if you're interested in creating your own game.
